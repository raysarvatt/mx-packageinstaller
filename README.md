# mx-packageinstaller

This is a fork of the original [MX Package Installer](https://github.com/AdrianTM/mx-packageinstaller) adapted to work with Qt5 instead of Qt6, for compatibility with older systems.

## Modifications

- Ported code from Qt6 to Qt5.
- Ensured compatibility with Debian-based systems using Qt5 libraries.
